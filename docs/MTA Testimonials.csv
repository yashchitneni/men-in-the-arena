Surrounding myself with men who are excelling in life in many areas I’d like to also excel has made me raise the bar in my own life.

No human is immune from this fact. Surround yourself with these beasts crushing it in personal, professional, and other realms of life across entrepreneurship, corporate, family life, fitness/ finances/ etc and you will rise to that average. Learn and grow here"
"Men In The Arena has had a profound impact as my life. Community, brotherhood, friendship, an outlet for my thoughts and daily stressors, killer workouts, better communication skills, leadership and event planning opportunities. Shall I go on? In a way, the group has helped me define and realize my own purpose and mission in life. It’s provided so much joy and pushed me to fight for what I want out of my life. There truly is a place in Men In The Arena for every man. ",Jake Morsch,"It’s important because when we show up with and for our brothers, it enables us to show up as the men we need and want to be for others in our lives. We need to communicate and lean on each other in good times and in bad. We need to share our journey because we never know what others are going through and the impact it may leave. It just might help a fellow brother through a tough time, even if we never know it. We’re never alone when we continue to show up with our brothers. "
"#1 It becomes a staple / great social time working out with other like minded men, I do 90% of 10-12 weekly session alone. #2 Helped me work on stepping up and lead / work on my public speaking abilities. #3 Pushed me to step into a new area of life I haven’t spend much time, helping others outside of my immediate circle. ",Robin Perségol,All of the above. 
"Making friends has always been easy, however, developing greater value and intention behind relationships for purpose of lifting up myself and other men around me with the support of MITA has been a critical and impactful element in my life since moving to Austin. I’ve met others who share similar passions, visions, ideas, etc, and, foundationely we all want to become greater men.  ",Kevin Kurz,"Life in this world is getting increasing more chaotic, noisy; competitive, and downright crazy. Men need a safe place to be challenged in various arenas whether that be fitness or just being vulnerable in discussions and sharing emotions about their struggles. "
"MTA has introduced me to such a wide and diverse group of men who are looking to improve in almost every facet of their life. It's acted as a healthy measuring stick on my habits, decisions, and actions to show me where I can improve and where I can serve. The camaraderie that this group provides has catalyzed so much growth for me over the last year+",Jack Lesser,"Having an outlet to do hard things and work/collaborate/build together strengthens our mind, body, and soul. This group doesn't require really anything other than being willing to step out of your comfort zone and work to improve who you are vs. who you were yesterday."
